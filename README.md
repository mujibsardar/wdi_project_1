# Monarch Free Chess


## Overview

This is a simplified version of a two player chess game. Unlike conventional chess, players 
* Cannot put the opponents king in check. 
* Can only move chess pieces according to set rules with no exceptions (e.g. pawns can only move forward one cell regardless of where they are).
* Cannot castle
* Cannot use any of the pawn passing rules (En passant)

The objective is to capture as many high value pieces from the opponent within a pre-defined period. Whoever ends up with the most pieces
worth more than the opponents total captured pieces value wins.
